## Overview
Employee handbook app consists of only two screens but at the same it supports network requests and their caching, various actions with data (search, sorting, filtering) and screen state management (different loading and error states).

## Getting started
If you want to read about app architecture, you can check [this](https://github.com/chuvalik/Employee-handbook/blob/main/documentation/Architecture.md) link.


## Useful links
This app was implemented as my implementation of [this](https://github.com/appKODE/trainee-test-android) test assignment. You can get the design from [here](https://www.figma.com/file/GRRKONipVClULsfdCAuVs1/KODE-Trainee-Dev-%D0%9E%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8C'21?node-id=11%3A14413) and api from [here](https://kode-education.stoplight.io/docs/trainee-test/b3A6MjUxNDM5Mjg-get-users). There is an issue with loading user profile images on the backend side.
